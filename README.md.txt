A simple implementation of the eigenface model with python, using Olivetti Faces dataset. In this implementation of EF model contains:
- Preprocessing of the data based around Olivetti Faces dataset.
- Training of the model.
- A simple method to interrogate the model, at the moment the a simple text is retrieve just as a proof of concept.
